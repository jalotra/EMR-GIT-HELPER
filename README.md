## What is the objective of this Homework ? 
1. To practice all the Git Commands that you have learned till now.
2. To learn how a project is structured into smaller bins and there uses.
3. To make you accustomed to the great Github UI.

## What do you have to do ?
**FORK THIS REPOSITORY AND GO THE WORK IN YOUR REPO**. <br />
1. This project is a noob-project that makes you write a noob=algorithm i.e (Matrix-Multiplication).
2. GOTO `src/matrix_multiplication` and you have to fill the `matrix_mul` function.
3. Then run `bash run.sh` to compile and link the `.o` files. 
4. This will create a binary namely `main` .
5. Run this `main` to see the verdict on the Trivial test-cases that I have written.
